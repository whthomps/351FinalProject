Hi! Just wanted to let you know that GitHub doesn't let you see the UX from IpyWidgets. 
Also, many of the queries are long so I deleted the outputs when I uploaded this (there was almost 4,000 lines with the outputs)
To see the UX and outputs, please view my demo video (must be signed in with USC email)!
